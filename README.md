- 👋 Hi, I’m @belindathemoon - not to be confused with the inner satellite of the planet Uranus. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belinda_(moon)]
- 👀 I’m interested in planetary astrobiology, exlporation of ocean and terrestrial worlds, exoplanets,
      science communication & public engagement with astronomy, printing arts, and open-source software!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Astropy and how to write useful code for automating the archiving of observational planetary data.
      I'm also learning Vim, and getting to know the command line very well.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on astronomy or planetary projects, archiving and documentation, and educational projects
