- 👋 Hi, I’m @belindathemoon - like the inner satellite of the planet Uranus. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belinda_(moon)]
- 👀 I’m interested in planetary astrobiology, exploration of ocean and icy worlds,
      science communication & public engagement with astronomy, accessibility, art, and open-source software!
- 🌱 I’m currently a graduate student in the Earth and Planetary Sciences department at Johns Hopkins University. I do lab science relevant to solar system worlds.
- 💞️ I’d love to collaborate on planetary projects, archiving and documentation, and educational projects
